                <p>Do you want to know how to design and program the computers powering some of today’s
                   greatest innovations? Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how
                   Google’s self-driving car is even possible, or how your music and photos live in the cloud? Maybe
                   you want to know how computers protect businesses — and people — and other cybersecurity
                   issues. AUM’s Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based on the latest ACM/IEEE
                   recommendations and an emphasis on high-performance computing, will prepare you for a career
                   in computer programming, networking, database management, multimedia design or technology
                   architecture.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You’ll have access to the most powerful computational resources and expertise in the
                        country through our partnership with the NSF-supported Extreme Science and Engineering
                        Discovery Environment.</li>
                    <li>Computer Science faculty are engaged in the private sector, supporting research and partnerships with national and           international user groups and initiatives.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Put your Degree to Work</h3>
