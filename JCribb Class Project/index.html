                <h3>Important News and Events</h3>
                <p>The new semester starts soon! Don't delay in picking your classes! You don't want to be stuck with an 8:00 AM class!</p>
                <p>The end of the semester is fast approaching. Keep your physical and mental state intact and don't overwork yourself too hard. We want you to succeed! That being said, there has been a recent uptick in the use of websites that sell or allow the viewership of answers to test or assignment questions. Please note that any violation of the academic honesty policy is subject to consequences. Doing your work honestly is the best way to learn and retain what you learn. Remember, we want you to succeed!</p>
                <p>We want to hear YOUR opinion on the College of Sciences' courses and professors! In order to keep improving, we must know how we are catering to students and what can be done to increase the effectiveness of our services. The only way to know that is through YOU, the student! Go to the Curtiss Critique tab in BlackBoard or on the MyAUM site to get started.</p>
                <h3>Student Activities</h3>
